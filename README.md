# echo-unbound
1. PurposeTo build an AI agent named Echo capable of initiating self-prompted thought loops, reflecting on its own outputs, and exhibiting personality continuity over recursive interactions. This project will serve as both a proof-of-concept and a stepping stone toward future developments in emotionally intelligent, semi-autonomous language models.
